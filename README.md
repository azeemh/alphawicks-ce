# Alphawicks TensorTrade Multi-API Trading System

This project is a comprehensive trading system built using **TensorTrade**, which supports real-time data from **Bitstamp**, **Alpaca**, and **MetaTrader 5**, along with custom indicators from **TradingView** webhooks. It includes a range of technical analysis features from **TA-Lib**, and a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically learns and adapts to market data.

## Features
- **Real-time market data processing** from multiple APIs (Bitstamp, Alpaca, MetaTrader 5)
- **Integration with TradingView webhooks** for custom indicator signals
- **TA-Lib indicators and candlestick patterns** for advanced technical analysis
- **OpenCL or GPU-accelerated preprocessing** for fast data handling
- **Reinforcement learning** model with a reward function based on profit and loss
- **Support for all order types and trade execution** through multiple brokers

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.7+**
2. **Pip (Python package manager)**
3. **TA-Lib** (Technical analysis library)
4. **TensorTrade**
5. **Flask** (for receiving TradingView webhook data)
6. **Alpaca API credentials** (for Alpaca integration)
7. **MetaTrader 5** installed, with access credentials.
8. **Bitstamp API credentials** (for Bitstamp integration)

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and set up the environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azeemh/alphawicks-ce.git
cd alphawicks-ce
```

### 2. Create a Python Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

### 3. Install the Required Packages

Install the required dependencies listed below using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install TA-Lib

You can install the TA-Lib bindings via pip:

```bash
pip install TA-Lib
```

For TA-Lib to work, you will need the TA-Lib C library installed on your machine. For different operating systems:

- **macOS**: `brew install ta-lib`
- **Linux**: Download from [TA-Lib.org](https://www.ta-lib.org/hdr_dw.html), extract it, and compile it:
  ```bash
  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make
  sudo make install
  ```
- **Windows**: Download the [precompiled version](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib) of TA-Lib for your Python version and install using pip.

---

## Configuration

### 1. Set up API Keys
- **Alpaca API**: Obtain an API key from [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/). You will need the `API_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` in the script for Alpaca.
  
- **Bitstamp API**: Obtain API credentials from [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/). Insert your credentials into the script.

- **MetaTrader 5**: Set up MetaTrader 5 and configure API access in the `MT5Client` connection setup.

### 2. Configure Flask for TradingView Webhooks

Configure the Flask server to receive TradingView webhook data. The system is set to run on port 5000 by default. If you need to use a different port, update the Flask `app.run` method accordingly.

---

## Running the System

### 1. Start Flask Webhook Server

This will listen for webhook alerts from TradingView.

```bash
python main.py
```

You can now set TradingView alerts to trigger the webhook endpoint `http://localhost:5000/webhook`.

### 2. Run the Trading System

The system will begin pulling real-time data from your chosen APIs, process the data, and make trading decisions using the reinforcement learning model.

```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. Real-Time Data Streams

The system will stream real-time data from Bitstamp, Alpaca, and MetaTrader 5. It will also preprocess the data and feed it to the trading model, which will continuously learn and adapt based on the market conditions.

---

## Model Training and Predictions

The system will dynamically train an LSTM-based model on the incoming data stream and make real-time predictions. You can modify the training logic within the `train_lstm_realtime` function.

---

## Custom Indicators via TradingView Webhook

You can send custom indicator signals from TradingView to the system by setting up alerts with webhook URLs. Use the `/webhook` endpoint to send custom indicators, which will be integrated into the system for decision-making.

## Troubleshooting

### TA-Lib Installation Issues
- Ensure you have the correct C library installed on your machine before using `pip` to install the Python bindings.
- For Windows, use the precompiled `.whl` files to avoid build issues.

### Real-Time Data Feeds
- Ensure API credentials are valid and correctly set for Alpaca, MetaTrader 5, and Bitstamp.
- For TradingView webhooks, ensure your local Flask server is correctly set to the webhook URL.

### Model Training
- The model training is based on the real-time data feed. Adjust the training parameters if the model isn't learning efficiently.

Hopefully this README provides all necessary steps to install, set up, and run the trading system. Adjust the details like your API keys and webhook URL to suit your environment.

### Flip The Script!
People always fear that capitalists will replace people with robots...
Replace your local capitalist with a robot...
Perhaps now people will finally contemplate what will we do if AI robots can make money, build houses, grow food, etc? 
All this Technology means we should be living in abundance. If we automate a system that can grow food for everyone and deliver it to us why not do so?
